# Multiclass Logistic Regression on the Iris Dataset 🌸

This repository provides a fully commented and educational Python implementation of **multiclass logistic regression** using the classic Iris flower dataset.

## 🚀 Project Summary

This script demonstrates:

- How to load and explore the Iris dataset
- Visual exploratory data analysis using `seaborn.pairplot`
- Preprocessing with `StandardScaler`
- Building and training a logistic regression model for 3-class classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Interpretation of model coefficients for each class

All steps include inline print statements, example outputs, and notes to help learners **understand both the "how" and the "why"**.
